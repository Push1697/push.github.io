I**ntroduction:** [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Web_Services) is a vast cloud ecosystem that offers immense flexibility and power. However, with great power comes great responsibility. Managing who can access your AWS resources and what they can do with them is crucial. This is where **AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)** comes into play.

In this comprehensive and conversational blog post, we will deeply dive into AWS IAM users. We’ll not only cover creating and deleting IAM users but also explore the finer points of user management, security, and best practices. By the end, you’ll be equipped with the knowledge to navigate the IAM landscape confidently.

**Chapter 1:** Understanding AWS IAM Users AWS IAM users are the cornerstone of access control within your AWS environment. Before we dive into the practical aspects of creating and deleting IAM users, let’s ensure we have a solid understanding of what they are and why they matter.

***Imagine IAM Users as Real People:*** Think of IAM users as virtual individuals or entities within your AWS account. Each user is assigned a set of permissions that dictate what they can and cannot do.

What’s an **IAM User?** An IAM user is an entity that represents a person or an application within your AWS account. Each IAM user has a unique set of security credentials.

Why Are IAM Users Important? Imagine your AWS account as a bustling office building. Without IAM users, everyone has the master key to every room. IAM users provide individual keys, ensuring that only authorized personnel can access specific areas.

**Chapter 2:** Creating IAM Users (Step-by-Step) Creating [IAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/intro-structure.html) users is a fundamental task in user management. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you do it right:

**Step 1: Access the IAM Dashboard**

* Log in to your AWS Management Console.

* Open the IAM dashboard.
    
* Select users — In this section, you will be able to edit the users, create, edit and update them.
    

**Step 2: Adding a New User**

* In the navigation pane, click on “Users.”
    
* Hit the “Create user” button.

**Step 3: User Details**

* Enter a username.
    
* Specify the type of access: programmatic or AWS Management Console.

Create a user

Here you can give access of the console to the person ( User) you are creating. In which you can specify a user in the [Identity centre](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html) or simply create an IAM user.

Credentials details

> *You can autogenerate passwords which is suitable so that user can create their own password after the first login.*

* Assign permissions by adding the user to a group or attaching policies directly.

Assigning Permissions and user roles

You can assign [Permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/introduction_access-management.html), create groups, copy permissions of different users that we have already, or attach the policies directly.

We will learn about attaching policies in different article. Where I will provide you in depth guide to adding the roles, permissions, creating groups.

For now, we are moving forward without assigning any kind of roles to our IAM user.

* Review and create the user.

Login credentials

You can use the console sign-in URL to log in via the credentials provided.

**Chapter 3:** Deleting IAM Users (Step-by-Step) While creating IAM users is vital, so is cleaning up when they’re no longer needed. Here’s how you can delete IAM users responsibly:

**Step 1: Navigate to the User List**

* Access the IAM dashboard.
    
* Click on “Users” in the left-hand navigation pane.
    

**Step 2: Select the User**

* Click on the user you want to delete.
    

**Step 3: Delete the User**

* On the user details page, click the “Delete user” button.
    
* Double-check the user’s permissions and policies to avoid accidental deletions.
    

**Chapter 4:** IAM User Management Best Practices Managing IAM users isn’t just about creating and deleting them; it’s an ongoing process. Here are some best practices to consider:

1. Least Privilege: Follow the principle of least privilege, ensuring that users have only the permissions necessary for their tasks.
    
2. Regular Key Rotation: Regularly rotate access keys and passwords to enhance security.
    
3. Use Groups: Group users with similar access needs and assign permissions to groups rather than individuals.
    
4. Monitoring and Auditing: Implement robust tracking and auditing of user activities to detect and respond to suspicious behaviour.
    
5. De-provisioning: Develop and enforce de-provisioning policies to remove access promptly when users no longer require it.
    

**Chapter 5:** **Advanced IAM Concepts and Security Beyond the basics of creating and deleting IAM users, let’s explore some advanced IAM concepts:**

* IAM Roles: Roles provide temporary permissions for users or services, enabling cross-account access and minimising security risks.
    
* Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Implement MFA to add an extra layer of security to user accounts.
    
* Identity Federation: Federate identities from external sources (e.g., Active Directory) to AWS IAM for streamlined access management.
    

**Chapter 6:** Recap and Final Thoughts IAM user management isn’t a one-time task; it’s an ongoing commitment to security and efficiency. To recap:

* IAM users are virtual entities representing real individuals or applications.
    
* Creating IAM users follows a straightforward process within the IAM dashboard.
    
* Deleting IAM users should be done carefully to avoid unintended consequences.
    
* Best practices, such as least privilege and regular key rotation, enhance IAM security.
    
* Advanced IAM concepts like roles, **MFA**, and identity federation provide additional layers of control.
    

Remember, IAM is your key master to the AWS kingdom. Properly managing IAM users ensures that only the right people have access to the right resources. Stay secure, stay in control, and explore the AWS world with confidence.

Conclusion: IAM users are the linchpin of secure and efficient AWS resource management. By mastering the art of creating, managing, and deleting IAM users, you not only bolster the security of your AWS environment but also ensure that your resources are used effectively.

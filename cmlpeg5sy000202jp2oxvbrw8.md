In the world of DevOps, a pipeline isn't just a script that runs tests — it's the **factory floor** of your software delivery. A well-architected pipeline ensures that code flows from a developer's laptop to production reliably, securely, and rapidly.

This guide walks you through building a complete CI/CD pipeline for a basic Node.js application using **GitHub Actions**, **Docker**, and **AWS** from scratch. Every file, every keyword, every config is explained so you can build the same pipeline yourself **without ever opening the GitHub repo**.

Whether you're a beginner or refining up your skills, this is the kind of pipeline you'd find behind any serious production deployment.

## 1\. Architecture Overview

Before diving into code, let's understand the flow. We aren't just "deploying code"; we are orchestrating a **software supply chain**.

### The Pipeline Stages

| Stage | What It Does | Key Tools |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Build** | Clean install (`npm ci`), syntax check | Node.js 20, npm |
| **Test** | Run unit/integration tests | Jest / npm test |
| **Security** | Dependency audit + static analysis | npm audit, CodeQL |
| **Docker** | Build, scan, and push container image | Docker Buildx, Trivy |
| **Deploy** | Pull & run on EC2 via SSM (with rollback) | AWS OIDC, SSM |

### Pipeline Visualization

![GitHub Actions Pipeline — All 5 stages passed. Build (7s) → Test (13s) and Security (1m 10s) run in parallel → Docker (1m 11s) → Deploy (8s)](https://github.com/Push1697/devops-portfolio/raw/main/week1-cicd/assets/parallel_running_dashboard_ghactions.png align="left")

*The complete pipeline DAG in GitHub Actions. Notice how* ***Test*** *and* ***Security*** *run in parallel after Build, and Docker + Deploy only trigger on the* `main` branch. Total pipeline time: ~2m 49s.

> **Key design choice:** Test and Security are independent of each other. By running them in parallel (both use `needs: build`), we cut pipeline time without sacrificing quality gates.

---

## 2\. Project Setup — Build the Application

Before anything CI/CD, you need a working application. Here's exactly what to build.

### Step 1: Initialize the Node.js Project

```bash
mkdir week1-cicd && cd week1-cicd
npm init -y
npm install express express-graphql graphql
```

**What each package does:**

| Package | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `express` | Web framework — handles HTTP routing and middleware |
| `express-graphql` | Adds a `/graphql` endpoint with the GraphiQL IDE |
| `graphql` | Core library for defining schemas, types, and resolvers |

Your `package.json` should look like this:

```json
{
  "name": "node-ci-demo",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Sample Node.js app for CI/CD demo",
  "main": "server.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node server.js"
  },
  "license": "MIT",
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^5.2.1",
    "express-graphql": "^0.12.0",
    "graphql": "^15.10.1"
  }
}
```

> 💡 **Important:** After running `npm install`, a `package-lock.json` file is generated. **You must commit this file** — the pipeline uses `npm ci` which requires it.

### Step 2: Create the Data File (`MOCK_DATA.json`)

```json
[
  { "id": 1, "firstName": "Asha", "lastName": "Iyer", "email": "asha.iyer@example.com", "password": "pass1234" },
  { "id": 2, "firstName": "Noah", "lastName": "Cole", "email": "noah.cole@example.com", "password": "pass2345" },
  { "id": 3, "firstName": "Mina", "lastName": "Khan", "email": "mina.khan@example.com", "password": "pass3456" },
  { "id": 4, "firstName": "Luis Kumar", "lastName": "Santos", "email": "luis.santos@example.com", "password": "pass4567" }
]
```

### Step 3: Create the Server (`server.js`)

The server code sets up:

| Endpoint | Type | What It Does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/` | HTML | Interactive user search UI |
| `/graphql` | GraphQL | Full GraphQL API with queries + mutations |
| `/rest/getAllUsers` | REST | Returns all users as JSON |
| `/api/users/search?q=` | REST | Search users by name or email |

Here's the core structure of `server.js`:

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const graphql = require("graphql");
const { graphqlHTTP } = require("express-graphql");

const app = express();
const PORT = 5000;
const userData = require("./MOCK_DATA.json");

const {
  GraphQLObjectType,
  GraphQLSchema,
  GraphQLList,
  GraphQLInt,
  GraphQLString,
} = graphql;

// Define the User type (what fields a "User" has)
const UserType = new GraphQLObjectType({
  name: "User",
  fields: () => ({
    id: { type: GraphQLInt },
    firstName: { type: GraphQLString },
    lastName: { type: GraphQLString },
    email: { type: GraphQLString },
    password: { type: GraphQLString },
  }),
});

// Define queries (how to READ data)
const RootQuery = new GraphQLObjectType({
  name: "RootQueryType",
  fields: {
    getAllUsers: {
      type: new GraphQLList(UserType),
      args: { id: { type: GraphQLInt } },
      resolve() { return userData; },         // Returns all users
    },
    findUserById: {
      type: UserType,
      args: { id: { type: GraphQLInt } },
      resolve(parent, args) {
        return userData.find((item) => item.id === args.id);
      },
    },
  },
});

// Define mutations (how to WRITE data)
const Mutation = new GraphQLObjectType({
  name: "Mutation",
  fields: {
    createUser: {
      type: UserType,
      args: {
        firstName: { type: GraphQLString },
        lastName: { type: GraphQLString },
        email: { type: GraphQLString },
        password: { type: GraphQLString },
      },
      resolve(parent, args) {
        const newUser = {
          id: userData.length + 1,
          ...args,
        };
        userData.push(newUser);
        return newUser;
      },
    },
  },
});

// Build the schema and mount GraphQL + REST endpoints
const schema = new GraphQLSchema({ query: RootQuery, mutation: Mutation });

app.use("/graphql", graphqlHTTP({ schema, graphiql: true }));

app.get("/rest/getAllUsers", (req, res) => { res.send(userData); });

app.get("/api/users/search", (req, res) => {
  const query = (req.query.q || "").toLowerCase().trim();
  const results = query
    ? userData.filter((u) =>
        [u.firstName, u.lastName, u.email]
          .join(" ").toLowerCase().includes(query)
      )
    : userData;
  res.json(results);
});

// The "/" route serves an HTML page with a search UI (omitted for brevity)

app.listen(PORT, () => { console.log("Server running"); });
```

**Test it locally:**

```bash
npm start
# Open http://localhost:5000
```

![Application running at 15.207.102.213:5000 — The User Search interface showing 8 users, with a search bar and total count](https://github.com/Push1697/devops-portfolio/raw/main/week1-cicd/assets/application_interface.png align="left")

*The deployed application running on EC2. Notice the URL — this is the public IP of our AWS instance on port 5000, exactly what the pipeline deploys to.*

### Step 4: Create the Dockerfile (Multi-Stage Distroless Build)

This is where most beginners just write `FROM node` and call it a day. We don't do that.

```dockerfile
# Stage 1: Dependencies — use a full Node image to install packages
FROM node:20-alpine3.18 AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --omit=dev --ignore-scripts \
    && npm cache clean --force \
    && rm -rf /root/.npm /tmp/*

# Stage 2: Runtime — copy only what's needed into a minimal image
FROM gcr.io/distroless/nodejs20-debian12:nonroot
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder --chown=nonroot:nonroot /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY --chown=nonroot:nonroot server.js .
COPY --chown=nonroot:nonroot MOCK_DATA.json .
EXPOSE 5000
CMD ["server.js"]
```

**Line-by-line explanation:**

| Line | What It Does |
| --- | --- |
| `FROM node:20-alpine3.18 AS builder` | Stage 1 uses Alpine Linux (small) to install deps. Named `builder` for reference |
| `COPY package*.json ./` | Copies both `package.json` and `package-lock.json` into the container |
| `npm ci --omit=dev` | Clean install, production dependencies only — skips devDependencies |
| `--ignore-scripts` | Skips lifecycle scripts (postinstall, etc.) — reduces attack surface |
| `npm cache clean --force` | Removes npm cache — smaller image layer |
| `FROM gcr.io/distroless/nodejs20-debian12:nonroot` | Stage 2 uses **Google's Distroless** — no shell, no package manager, no OS utils |
| `COPY --from=builder` | Copies `node_modules` from Stage 1 into the final image |
| `--chown=nonroot:nonroot` | Files owned by non-root user — container never runs as root |
| `CMD ["server.js"]` | Distroless uses exec form (no shell), so we pass the filename directly |

> 💡 **Result:** Our final image is **51.6 MB** instead of ~1 GB with a standard `node:20` base. You can verify this in Docker Hub — smaller image = faster pulls = faster deployments.

### Step 5: Create the `.dockerignore`

```text
node_modules
npm-debug.log
.git
.env
tests/
*.test.js
coverage/
README.md
```

**Why this matters:** Without `.dockerignore`, Docker copies your entire `node_modules` (which gets rebuilt inside), `.git` history, and test files into the build context — making builds slower and images larger.

### Step 6: Commit Everything

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add Node.js app with GraphQL + REST endpoints"
git push origin main
```

> ⚠️ **Don't forget** `package-lock.json`! The pipeline's `npm ci` command requires it. If missing, the build fails immediately.

---

## 3\. Docker Hub Setup — Create Your Token

Before the pipeline can push images, you need a Docker Hub account and an access token.

### Step 1: Navigate to Personal Access Tokens

Go to Docker Hub → **Account Settings** → **Security** → **Personal access tokens**.

![Docker Hub — Personal Access Tokens page showing "Generate new token" button](https://github.com/Push1697/devops-portfolio/raw/main/week1-cicd/assets/docker_pat_token.png align="left")

*The Docker Hub PAT settings page. If this is your first token, you'll see the "Generate new token" button.*

### Step 2: Create the Access Token

Click **Generate new token** and fill in:

| Field | Value | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Access token description** | `github_actions` | Identifies what this token is used for |
| **Expiration date** | 30 days (or more) | Set based on your security policy |
| **Access permissions** | **Read & Write** | Push requires Write; Read pulls images |

![Docker Hub — Creating a PAT with description "github_actions", 30-day expiry, Read & Write permissions](https://github.com/Push1697/devops-portfolio/raw/main/week1-cicd/assets/create_tocken_docker.png align="left")

*Fill in exactly as shown. The "Read & Write" permission lets your pipeline push images to Docker Hub.*

### Step 3: Copy and Save the Token

After clicking **Generate**, Docker Hub shows your token **once**. Copy it immediately.

```text
Example: dckr_pat_ABC123DEF456GHI789JKL0MN
```

> ⚠️ **This token will never be shown again.** If you lose it, you must generate a new one.

**Why a Personal Access Token (PAT) over your password?**

* Can be **revoked** without changing your Docker Hub password
    
* Can be **scoped** to specific permissions (Read, Write, Delete)
    
* Can be **audited** — you see when it was last used
    
* If compromised, your account password stays safe

## 4\. GitHub Repository Secrets

Now we add all credentials to GitHub so the pipeline can use them securely.

### How to Add a Secret

1. Go to your GitHub repo → **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
    
2. Click **New repository secret**
    
3. Enter the **Name** and **Value**
    
4. Click **Add secret**
    

### Secrets You Need to Add

| Secret Name | Value | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` | Your Docker Hub username (e.g., `deviltalks`) | Docker login |
| `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` | The PAT from Step 3 above | Docker login |
| `AWS_ROLE_ARN` | `arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/github-actions-oidc-role` | OIDC authentication |
| `EC2_INSTANCE_ID` | `i-0xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx` | SSM deployment target |

> 💡 **How GitHub Secrets work:** Values are encrypted at rest using libsodium sealed boxes. They are **never** printed in logs — even if your pipeline does `echo ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_TOKEN }}`, it shows `***`. They cannot be read by forks or PRs from forks.

---

## 5\. AWS Infrastructure Setup

This is where most tutorials skip. But in real life, **infrastructure is where 90% of issues happen**.

### 5.1 AWS OIDC Configuration (No Static Access Keys!)

We do **not** use `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`. Those are long-lived credentials — if they leak, an attacker has access until you manually rotate them. That's unacceptable.

Instead, we use **OpenID Connect (OIDC)**:

```text
GitHub Actions ──► (JWT token) ──► AWS STS ──► Temporary credentials (15 min)
```

AWS says: *"I trust GitHub Actions from* ***this specific repo*** *to assume* ***this specific role****, and only for a short time."*

**Step-by-step setup:**

1. Go to AWS IAM → **Identity Providers** → **Add provider**
    
2. Select **OpenID Connect**
    
3. Provider URL: `https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com`
    
4. Audience: `sts.amazonaws.com`
    
5. Click **Add provider**
    

**Then create the IAM Role:**

1. Go to IAM → **Roles** → **Create role**
    
2. Trusted entity type: **Web identity**
    
3. Identity provider: `token.actions.githubusercontent.com`
    
4. Audience: `sts.amazonaws.com`
    
5. Click **Next**
    
6. Attach permission: `AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore`
    
7. Role name: `github-actions-oidc-role`
    
8. Click **Create role**
    

**Update the Trust Policy** (IAM → Roles → your role → Trust relationships → Edit):

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Federated": "arn:aws:iam::YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID:oidc-provider/token.actions.githubusercontent.com"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "token.actions.githubusercontent.com:aud": "sts.amazonaws.com"
        },
        "StringLike": {
          "token.actions.githubusercontent.com:sub": "repo:Push1697/devops-portfolio:*"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

> ⚠️ **Critical:** The `sub` condition locks this to your exact repository. Without it, *any* GitHub repo could assume your AWS role.

Copy the Role ARN (e.g., `arn:aws:iam::450070307294:role/github-actions-oidc-role`) → save it as the `AWS_ROLE_ARN` GitHub Secret.

### 5.2 EC2 Instance Preparation

Your EC2 deployment target needs four things:

| Requirement | How to Set It Up |
| --- | --- |
| **Docker installed** | `sudo yum install docker -y && sudo systemctl enable --now docker` |
| **SSM Agent running** | Pre-installed on Amazon Linux. Verify: `systemctl status amazon-ssm-agent` |
| **IAM Instance Role** | Attach a role with `AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore` policy (see below) |
| **Security Group** | Allow inbound TCP on port 5000 from `0.0.0.0/0` |

**How to attach** `AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore` to your EC2:

1. Go to AWS EC2 → **Instances** → Select your instance
    
2. Look for **IAM Role** in the details panel
    
3. If no role is attached: **Actions** → **Security** → **Modify IAM role**
    
4. Select a role that has `AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore` attached (or create one)
    
5. Click **Update IAM role**
    

**To verify the role's permissions:**

1. Go to IAM → **Roles** → Click the role name
    
2. Under **Permissions**, confirm `AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore` is listed
    
3. If missing: **Add permissions** → **Attach policies** → Search for `AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore`
    

> 💡 **Why SSM instead of SSH?** With SSM Run Command, you don't need to open port 22 to the internet. No SSH keys to manage, no bastion hosts. All commands are logged in CloudTrail. It's the modern, secure way to run commands on EC2.

## 6\. The Pipeline — Complete `ci-cd-pipeline.yml` Walkthrough

This file lives at `.github/workflows/ci-cd-pipeline.yml`. Let's dissect **every single line**.

### 6.1 Name, Triggers & Permissions

```yaml
name: week-1 CI-CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: ["main", "develop"]
  pull_request:
    branches: ["main"]
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  contents: read
  id-token: write
  security-events: write
```

**Line-by-line:**

| Line | What It Does |
| --- | --- |
| `name: week-1 CI-CD Pipeline` | Display name shown in GitHub Actions tab |
| `on.push.branches: ["main", "develop"]` | Runs on every push to `main` or `develop` branches |
| `on.pull_request.branches: ["main"]` | Runs when a PR is opened/updated against `main` — validates before merge |
| `workflow_dispatch:` | Adds a **"Run workflow"** button in GitHub UI for manual triggers |
| `permissions.contents: read` | Allows the workflow to read (checkout) your repository code |
| `permissions.id-token: write` | **Critical for OIDC** — lets GitHub generate a JWT token for AWS auth |
| `permissions.security-events: write` | Required for CodeQL to upload scan results to GitHub's Security tab |

> ⚠️ **#1 mistake beginners make:** Forgetting `id-token: write`. Without it, the OIDC handshake with AWS fails silently and the deploy job errors with a cryptic permissions message.

### 6.2 Global Environment Variables

```yaml
env:
  NODE_VERSION: "20"
  APP_DIR: "week1-cicd"
  IMAGE_NAME: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}/node-ci-demo
  CONTAINER_NAME: "node-ci-demo"
  APP_PORT: "5000"
  AWS_REGION: "ap-south-1"
  AWS_ROLE_ARN: ${{ secrets.AWS_ROLE_ARN }}
  EC2_INSTANCE_ID: ${{ secrets.EC2_INSTANCE_ID }}
```

| Variable | Value | Why It's Here |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `NODE_VERSION` | `"20"` | Used by `setup-node` — change once, applies everywhere |
| `APP_DIR` | `"week1-cicd"` | Our app lives in a subdirectory, not the repo root |
| `IMAGE_NAME` | `<username>/node-ci-demo` | Full Docker image name — constructed from secrets |
| `CONTAINER_NAME` | `"node-ci-demo"` | Name of the Docker container on EC2 |
| `APP_PORT` | `"5000"` | Port the app listens on |
| `AWS_REGION` | `"ap-south-1"` | Mumbai region — change to your deploy region |
| `AWS_ROLE_ARN` | From secrets | The IAM role ARN for OIDC auth |
| `EC2_INSTANCE_ID` | From secrets | Target EC2 instance for deployment |

> 💡 **DRY Principle:** If you ever need to change the Node version, image name, or AWS region, you change it in **one place** — not scattered across 5 jobs. as this practice creates simplicity and manageability of your pipeline if it is complex.

### 6.3 Concurrency Control

```yaml
concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true
```

| Keyword | What It Does |
| --- | --- |
| `group:` | Creates a unique group per workflow + branch combo |
| `cancel-in-progress` | If you push 3 commits rapidly, only the **latest** pipeline runs — older ones are cancelled |

**Why this matters:** This saves GitHub Actions minutes (and money). Without it, 3 rapid pushes = 3 concurrent pipelines fighting over resources.

### 6.4 Job 1: Build

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    name: Build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: ${{ env.NODE_VERSION }}
          cache: npm
          cache-dependency-path: ${{ env.APP_DIR }}/package-lock.json

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
        working-directory: ${{ env.APP_DIR }}

      - name: Validate server entry
        run: node -c server.js
        working-directory: ${{ env.APP_DIR }}

      - name: Lint (if configured)
        run: npm run lint --if-present
        working-directory: ${{ env.APP_DIR }}
```

**Step-by-step explanation:**

| Step | What It Does | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `actions/checkout@v4` | Clones your repository into the GitHub runner | Without this, the runner VM has no code |
| `actions/setup-node@v4` | Installs Node.js 20 on the runner | `cache: npm` reuses previously downloaded packages |
| `cache-dependency-path` | Points to `week1-cicd/package-lock.json` | Tells the cache which lockfile to hash for cache invalidation |
| `npm ci` | Clean install from lockfile | Deterministic — fails if lockfile is missing or out of sync |
| `node -c server.js` | **Syntax check only** — parses the file without executing it | Catches typos, missing brackets, or syntax errors instantly |
| `npm run lint --if-present` | Runs linting **only if** a `lint` script exists in `package.json` | `--if-present` prevents failure if no linter is configured |

**What is** `runs-on: ubuntu-latest`? This tells GitHub to run this job on a fresh Ubuntu virtual machine. Each job gets its own clean VM — nothing carries over between jobs unless you explicitly share artifacts.

**What is** `working-directory`? Our app lives inside `week1-cicd/`, not the repo root. This keyword tells each step to `cd` into that folder before running the command.

**Why** `npm ci` instead of `npm install`?

| Feature | `npm install` | `npm ci` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Uses `package-lock.json` | Optional | **Required** |
| Modifies lockfile | Yes | Never |
| Deletes `node_modules` first | No | **Yes** |
| Deterministic | No | **Yes** |
| Speed | Slower | **Faster** |

### 6.5 Job 2: Test

```yaml
  test:
    name: Test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: ${{ env.NODE_VERSION }}
          cache: npm
          cache-dependency-path: ${{ env.APP_DIR }}/package-lock.json

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
        working-directory: ${{ env.APP_DIR }}

      - name: Run tests (if configured)
        run: npm test --if-present
        working-directory: ${{ env.APP_DIR }}
```

**Key keyword —** `needs: build`:

This creates a **dependency chain**. The `test` job waits for `build` to succeed before starting. If the build fails, test never runs — saving compute time and money.

> 💡 **Why does each job re-checkout and re-install?** Each GitHub Actions job runs on a **separate VM**. The VM from the Build job is destroyed when it finishes. So Test needs its own checkout and install. This is by design — isolation prevents contamination between jobs.

`npm test --if-present`: Runs the test script if it exists in `package.json`, otherwise skips gracefully. This is useful in early-stage projects where tests haven't been written yet.

### 6.6 Job 3: Security (Defense in Depth)

```yaml
  security:
    name: Security
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: ${{ env.NODE_VERSION }}
          cache: npm
          cache-dependency-path: ${{ env.APP_DIR }}/package-lock.json

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
        working-directory: ${{ env.APP_DIR }}

      - name: Run npm audit
        run: npm audit --audit-level=moderate || true
        working-directory: ${{ env.APP_DIR }}

      - name: CodeQL init
        uses: github/codeql-action/init@v4
        with:
          languages: javascript

      - name: CodeQL analyze
        uses: github/codeql-action/analyze@v4
```

**Notice:** Both `test` and `security` have `needs: build`. They are independent of each other, so **they run in parallel**. This is visible in the pipeline visualization above.

We use **three layers of security scanning** (Defense in Depth):

```text
Layer 1: npm audit        → Known vulnerabilities in npm packages
Layer 2: GitHub CodeQL     → Static analysis of YOUR code (injections, logic bugs)
Layer 3: Trivy            → OS-level CVEs in the Docker image (runs in Docker job)
```

**Keyword breakdown:**

| Keyword / Flag | What It Does |
| --- | --- |
| `npm audit --audit-level=moderate` | Only flag vulnerabilities rated moderate or higher |
| `|| true` | Don't fail the job on audit warnings — log them but continue |
| `codeql-action/init` | Downloads and initializes the CodeQL analysis engine for JavaScript |
| `codeql-action/analyze` | Runs the actual scan and uploads results to GitHub's Security tab |

> 💡 **Why** `|| true` on npm audit? In a real production pipeline, you might want `npm audit` to fail the build. Here we use `|| true` so advisory-level warnings don't block deploys during development. In stricter environments, remove the `|| true`.

### 6.7 Job 4: Docker Build, Scan & Push

This is the longest job. Let's break it down step by step.

```yaml
  docker:
    name: Docker
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: [test, security]
    if: github.event_name == 'push' && github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
```

| Keyword | What It Does |
| --- | --- |
| `needs: [test, security]` | Waits for **both** Test and Security to pass before starting |
| `if: github.event_name == 'push'` | Only runs on direct pushes, **not** on pull requests |
| `github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'` | Only runs on the `main` branch — feature branches never push images |

**Step 1 → Extract Docker Metadata (Smart Tagging):**

```yaml
      - name: Extract Docker metadata
        id: meta
        uses: docker/metadata-action@v5
        with:
          images: ${{ env.IMAGE_NAME }}
          tags: |
            type=ref,event=branch
            type=ref,event=pr
            type=sha,prefix={{branch}}-
            type=raw,value=latest,enable={{is_default_branch}}
```

This automatically generates Docker tags for your image:

| Tag Rule | Example Output | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `type=ref,event=branch` | `main` | Tags with branch name |
| `type=ref,event=pr` | `pr-42` | Tags for pull requests |
| `type=sha,prefix={{branch}}-` | `main-c260cb1` | Branch + short commit SHA |
| `type=raw,value=latest` | `latest` | Only on the default branch |

The SHA tag (`main-c260cb1`) is critical — it lets you trace any running container back to the **exact Git commit** that built it.

**Step 2 → Docker Hub Login:**

```yaml
      - name: Log in to Docker Hub
        uses: docker/login-action@v3
        with:
          username: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_TOKEN }}
```

This authenticates to Docker Hub using the secrets we configured earlier. The `password` field uses the PAT (Personal Access Token), **not** your actual Docker Hub password.

**Step 3 → Set Up Docker Buildx:**

```yaml
      - name: Set up Docker Buildx
        uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v3
```

**What is Buildx?** It's Docker's extended build tool. It enables multi-platform builds and, critically, **caching** support via GitHub Actions cache. Without Buildx, you can't use `cache-from` / `cache-to`.

**Step 4 → Build and Push:**

```yaml
      - name: Build and push
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v6
        with:
          context: ${{ env.APP_DIR }}
          file: ${{ env.APP_DIR }}/Dockerfile
          push: true
          tags: ${{ steps.meta.outputs.tags }}
          labels: ${{ steps.meta.outputs.labels }}
          cache-from: type=gha
          cache-to: type=gha,mode=max
```

| Keyword | What It Does |
| --- | --- |
| `context: ${{ env.APP_DIR }}` | Build context is the `week1-cicd/` directory |
| `file: ${{ env.APP_DIR }}/Dockerfile` | Path to our multi-stage Dockerfile |
| `push: true` | Pushes the built image to Docker Hub |
| `tags: ${{ steps.meta.outputs.tags }}` | Uses tags generated by the metadata step |
| `cache-from: type=gha` | **Pulls cached layers** from GitHub Actions cache |
| `cache-to: type=gha,mode=max` | **Saves all layers** to cache for future builds |

> 💡 **Why caching matters:** Without caching, Docker rebuilds every layer from scratch (~2-3 minutes). With `type=gha` caching, unchanged layers are reused — builds drop to ~30 seconds.

*Docker Hub showing our pushed image with 5 tags. The* `main-c260cb1` tag maps to a specific Git commit. Repository size: 51.6 MB (thanks to our distroless multi-stage build).

**Step 5 → Trivy Container Scan:**

```yaml
      - name: Trivy scan (optional)
        uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@master
        continue-on-error: true
        with:
          image-ref: ${{ env.IMAGE_NAME }}:latest
          format: sarif
          output: trivy-results.sarif

      - name: Upload Trivy results
        uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v3
        if: always()
        with:
          sarif_file: trivy-results.sarif
```

| Keyword | What It Does |
| --- | --- |
| `continue-on-error: true` | Trivy findings don't block the pipeline — they're informational |
| `format: sarif` | SARIF is a standard format that GitHub understands for its Security tab |
| `if: always()` | Upload results even if the Trivy scan step finds vulnerabilities |

![Build logs showing Docker buildx command with cache flags, metadata labels, and an error: "invalid tag node-ci-demo:main"](https://github.com/Push1697/devops-portfolio/raw/main/week1-cicd/assets/build_and_security_scan_logs.png align="left")

*An actual failed Docker build from our pipeline. The error* `invalid tag "/node-ci-demo:main"` happened because `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` was empty — the secret wasn't set yet. After adding the secret, this was resolved.

### 6.8 Job 5: Deploy with Automated Rollback

```yaml
  deploy:
    name: Deploy
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: docker
    if: github.event_name == 'push' && github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'

    steps:
      - name: Configure AWS credentials (OIDC)
        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4
        with:
          role-to-assume: ${{ env.AWS_ROLE_ARN }}
          aws-region: ${{ env.AWS_REGION }}

      - name: Deploy via SSM Run Command
        run: |
          aws ssm send-command \
            --document-name "AWS-RunShellScript" \
            --targets "Key=instanceids,Values=${{ env.EC2_INSTANCE_ID }}" \
            --parameters 'commands=["set -e","CURRENT_IMAGE=$(docker inspect -f {{.Image}} ${{ env.CONTAINER_NAME }} 2>/dev/null || echo none)","docker pull ${{ env.IMAGE_NAME }}:latest","docker stop ${{ env.CONTAINER_NAME }} || true","docker rm ${{ env.CONTAINER_NAME }} || true","if docker run -d --name ${{ env.CONTAINER_NAME }} -p ${{ env.APP_PORT }}:5000 ${{ env.IMAGE_NAME }}:latest; then echo Deploy succeeded; else echo Deploy failed, rolling back; [ \"$CURRENT_IMAGE\" != none ] && docker run -d --name ${{ env.CONTAINER_NAME }} -p ${{ env.APP_PORT }}:5000 $CURRENT_IMAGE; exit 1; fi"]' \
            --comment "Deploy node-ci-demo" \
            --region ${{ env.AWS_REGION }}
```

**Step 1 — OIDC Authentication:**

The `aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials` action:

1. Requests a JWT token from GitHub's OIDC provider
    
2. Sends it to AWS STS (Security Token Service)
    
3. AWS validates the token against the trust policy
    
4. Returns temporary credentials (valid for ~15 minutes)
    

**Step 2 — SSM Run Command (The Deployment Script):**

Here's what the script does, broken into readable steps:

```bash
# 1. Strict mode — exit immediately if any command fails
set -e

# 2. Save the currently running image hash (for rollback)
CURRENT_IMAGE=$(docker inspect -f '{{.Image}}' node-ci-demo 2>/dev/null || echo none)

# 3. Pull the latest image from Docker Hub
docker pull deviltalks/node-ci-demo:latest

# 4. Stop and remove the old container (ignore errors if it doesn't exist)
docker stop node-ci-demo || true
docker rm node-ci-demo || true

# 5. Start the new container — if it fails, rollback!
if docker run -d --name node-ci-demo -p 5000:5000 deviltalks/node-ci-demo:latest; then
  echo "✅ Deploy succeeded"
else
  echo "❌ Deploy failed — rolling back!"
  # Restore the previous working image
  if [ "$CURRENT_IMAGE" != "none" ]; then
    docker run -d --name node-ci-demo -p 5000:5000 $CURRENT_IMAGE
  fi
  exit 1
fi
```

**What makes this deployment script production-grade:**

| Feature | How We Do It |
| --- | --- |
| **Image hash capture** | Saves `CURRENT_IMAGE` before doing anything destructive |
| **Automatic rollback** | If new container fails to start, restores previous image |
| **Zero-downtime recovery** | Rollback is automatic — no manual intervention needed |
| `set -e` | Any command failure stops the script — no partial deploys |
| `|| true` on stop/rm | Gracefully handles first-ever deployment (no container to stop) |

You can see the full command JSON response including the* `CommandId`, the deployment commands with masked secrets (`***`), the target EC2 instance, and the "Pending" status. Notice how `IMAGE_NAME` and `AWS_ROLE_ARN` are masked → GitHub never exposes secrets in logs.

## 7\. Branch Protection & Governance

A pipeline is only as good as the rules protecting it. Without branch protection, anyone with repo access could push directly to `main` and bypass all checks.

### Setting Up Branch Protection Rules

Go to GitHub → **Settings** → **Branches** → **Add rule** → Branch name pattern: `main`

Enable these settings:

| Setting | What It Does |
| --- | --- |
| ✅ **Require pull request before merging** | Forces code review — prevents accidental pushes |
| ✅ **Require status checks to pass** | Blocks merge if Build / Test / Security / Docker fails |
| ✅ **Require code reviews** (1+ approver) | At least one peer must approve the PR |
| ✅ **Dismiss stale pull request approvals** | Re-review required if new commits are added after approval |
| ✅ **Require branches to be up to date** | Prevents merge conflicts in production |
| ✅ **Restrict who can push** | Only specific users/teams can bypass (rarely used) |

**What happens when someone tries to push directly to** `main`:

```text
$ git push origin main
remote: error: GH006: Protected branch update failed
remote: error: Required status check "Build" is expected
remote: error: At least 1 approving review is required
```

> 💡 **Without branch protection:** Any developer with push access can push broken code directly to production. **With it:** Every change must pass CI checks AND be reviewed by a peer before merging.

### Skipping CI (When You Need To)

Sometimes you push documentation changes or `.md` edits that don't need a full pipeline run. Add `[skip ci]` to your commit message:

```bash
git commit -m "docs: update README formatting [skip ci]"
git push origin main
```

GitHub Actions recognizes `[skip ci]`, `[ci skip]`, `[no ci]`, or `[skip actions]` in the commit message and **will not trigger any workflows** for that push.

> ⚠️ **Use sparingly.** Only skip CI for documentation-only changes. Never skip CI for code changes — that defeats the entire purpose of the pipeline.

### The Complete Governance Model

| Protection Layer | What It Prevents |
| --- | --- |
| **Branch protection** | Direct pushes to `main` → forces PR + review |
| **PR status checks** | Merging PRs with failing Build / Test / Security |
| **OIDC (no static keys)** | Leaked AWS credentials → tokens auto-expire in 15 min |
| **GitHub Secrets** | Credentials in code → encrypted, masked in logs, no fork access |
| **npm audit + CodeQL** | Vulnerable dependencies and code-level security flaws |
| **Trivy** | OS-level vulnerabilities in the Docker image |
| **Automated rollback** | Failed deployments staying live → auto-restores previous version |
| **Audit trail** | Untraceable changes → every commit, PR, and deploy is logged |

## 8\. Troubleshooting — Every Error We Hit

These aren't hypothetical — these are errors we **actually encountered** while building this pipeline. Every fix is documented.

### ❌ Error 1: `npm ci` fails — "package-lock.json not found"

```text
npm ERR! The `npm ci` command can only install with an existing package-lock.json
```

**Root cause:** You ran `npm install` locally but never committed `package-lock.json`.

**Fix:**

```bash
npm install                # generates package-lock.json
git add package-lock.json
git commit -m "chore: add lockfile for CI reproducibility"
git push origin main
```

---

### ❌ Error 2: Docker push — "denied: requested access to the resource is denied"

```text
ERROR: denied: requested access to the resource is denied
```

**Root cause:** One (or more) of these:

* `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` is your password, not a PAT
    
* PAT lacks Write permission
    
* `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` doesn't match the image name prefix (e.g., image is `deviltalks/node-ci-demo` but username is `deviltalks2`)
    

**Fix:**

1. Go to Docker Hub → Account Settings → Security → Delete old token
    
2. Generate a new PAT with **Read & Write** permissions
    
3. Update the `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` secret in GitHub
    
4. Verify `IMAGE_NAME` starts with your exact Docker Hub username
    

---

### ❌ Error 3: Docker build — "invalid tag: invalid reference format"

```text
ERROR: failed to build: invalid tag "/node-ci-demo:main": invalid reference format
```

**Root cause:** The `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` secret is **empty or not set**. The `IMAGE_NAME` env var becomes `/node-ci-demo` (leading slash) instead of `deviltalks/node-ci-demo`.

**Fix:**

1. Go to GitHub → Settings → Secrets → Actions
    
2. Verify `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` exists and has a value
    
3. Re-trigger the pipeline:
    

```bash
git commit --allow-empty -m "retry: fix docker username secret"
git push origin main
```

> 💡 This error is visible in the [build logs screenshot](#67-job-4-docker-build-scan--push) above — line 222 shows the exact error.

---

### ❌ Error 4: Deploy fails — SSM "Command failed"

**Root cause:** Usually one of:

* SSM Agent is stopped on EC2
    
* EC2 instance doesn't have the `AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore` IAM policy
    
* Port 5000 is blocked in Security Group
    
* Instance is in a different region than `AWS_REGION`
    

**Fix:**

```bash
# On the EC2 instance — restart SSM Agent:
sudo systemctl restart amazon-ssm-agent
sudo systemctl status amazon-ssm-agent

# Verify Docker is running:
sudo systemctl status docker
```

In AWS Console:

1. **IAM:** Verify the EC2 instance role has `AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore` attached
    
2. **EC2 → Security Groups:** Edit inbound rules → Add TCP 5000 from `0.0.0.0/0`
    
3. **Verify region:** Make sure `AWS_REGION` in your workflow matches the instance's actual region
    

---

### ❌ Error 5: OIDC fails — "Not authorized to perform sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity"

```text
Error: Not authorized to perform sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity
```

**Root cause:** The `sub` claim in your IAM trust policy doesn't match your repo.

**Fix:**

1. Verify the trust policy has the correct repo:
    

```json
"token.actions.githubusercontent.com:sub": "repo:Push1697/devops-portfolio:*"
```

2. Verify `permissions.id-token: write` is set in your workflow
    
3. Verify the OIDC Identity Provider exists in IAM with the correct audience (`sts.amazonaws.com`)
    

---

### ❌ Error 6: Docker login fails — "Username required"

```text
Run docker/login-action@v3
Error: Username required
```

**Root cause:** Secret name in the workflow doesn't match what's stored in GitHub. This is case-sensitive!

**Fix:**

1. Check your workflow file:
    

```yaml
# ✅ Correct — matches the secret name exactly
password: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_TOKEN }}

# ❌ Wrong — different secret name
password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_SECRET_KEY }}
```

2. In GitHub Secrets, verify the exact names: `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` and `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN`
    

---

### ❌ Error 7: Trivy upload fails — "Path does not exist: trivy-results.sarif"

```text
Error: Path does not exist: trivy-results.sarif
```

**Root cause:** The Trivy scan step was skipped or failed (often because the Docker build failed first), so no SARIF file was generated.

**Fix:** This is usually a downstream effect of another error. Fix the Docker build first, and the Trivy upload will work. The `if: always()` on the upload step ensures it runs even when Trivy fails, but it can't upload a file that doesn't exist.

---

## 9\. Summary

This isn't a toy pipeline. It's a **production-grade delivery system** that handles:

| Pillar | How We Address It |
| --- | --- |
| **Security** | OIDC (no static keys), GitHub Secrets, npm audit, CodeQL, Trivy |
| **Reliability** | `npm ci` for deterministic builds, automated tests |
| **Recoverability** | Automated rollback on deploy failure |
| **Traceability** | Docker tags tied to Git commit SHAs |
| **Efficiency** | Parallel jobs, Docker layer caching (`type=gha`), concurrency |
| **Governance** | Branch protection, PR reviews, status checks, audit trail |

By following this guide step by step, you've built something real — not a tutorial demo, but the same patterns used in production systems at companies shipping code daily.
